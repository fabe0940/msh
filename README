SUMMARY

The goal of this assignment is to write a shell (called msh which will stand
for “my shell”). Specifically, you are to write the framework for a linux shell
using the C (not C++) programming language. Once the shell is executing it will
prompt the user with the "?: " prompt. The user now may issue any command line
Linux command.


COMPILING

Just run the `make` command.


RUNNING

$ chmod u+x ./msh

$ ./msh
