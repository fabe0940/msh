SUMMARY

The goal of this assignment is to write a shell (called msh which will stand
for “my shell”). Specifically, you are to write the framework for a linux shell
using the C (not C++) programming language. Once the shell is executing it will
prompt the user with the "?: " prompt. The user now may issue any command line
Linux command.


COMPILING

Run the `make` command. An executable named `msh` will be generated in the
project's home directory.


RUNNING

Make sure the binary generated by make is executable.

$ chmod u+x ./msh

Now run it!

$ ./msh


COMMANDS AND SYNTAX

This shell should support a subset of bash syntax.

To do multiple commands on one line, seperate them with semicolons.

$ cmd_1 ; cmd_2

To get or set the PATH variable, use $PATH and export, respectively.

$ export PATH=$PATH:/new/path/to/append

To view history, run the `history` command.

$ history

The command `!!` will rerun the last command issued, and the command `!N` will
rerun command number N if N is still stored in history.

Pipes do not work in this shell at the moment. They don't break anything, but
their stdin/stdout are not connected. The command

$ ls | wc -l

is equivalend to

$ ls ; wc -l

To change directories, use the `cd` command.

$ cd /path/to/dir/
$ cd ../relative/dir/path/
